# Yuki Content Management

Yuki is a *very simple* Content Management system. Its intention is to provide basic access to HTML-files on an Apache Web Server running with PHP. You don't need a database to get started, but there will be extensions that provide database access.

## Getting started
All you need is an *Apache HTTP Server* with a *PHP* installation and the Apache module *mod_rewrite*.

1.	You may rename the `public` folder to whatever your document root folder is called. (Usually it is `htdocs`, `html` or `www`.)

2.	Then you may edit the `lib/conf.php` according to the instructions in the file.

Now you are able to add your HTML files and whatever you like.
