Yuki Content Management
=======================

Yuki is a *very simple* Content Management system. It's intention is to provide basic access to HTML-files on an Apache Web Server running with PHP. You don't need a database to get started, but there will be extensions that provide database access.

Currently it does't have working status and it's not recommended to use it. It also lacks documentation and support at the moment.
